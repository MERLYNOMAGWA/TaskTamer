      <h2>About TaskTamer</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
         <p>TaskTamer was born during a gap year by Merlyn Omagwa, a 17-year-old student who was tired of boring planners and procrastination. Inspired by how games keep us hooked with points, rewards, and goals, she teamed up with friends to create a new kind of productivity appâ€”one that feels more like play than pressure.</p>
         <p>TaskTamer helps students stay organized and motivated by turning everyday tasks into quests, challenges, and XP-earning adventures. From AI-powered smart scheduling to friendly competition, we make productivity feel less like a chore and more like a win.</p>
